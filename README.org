#+TITLE: helm-ext

Extensions to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]], which I find useful but are unlikely to be accepted in the
upstream.

A collection of dirty hacks for helm!

* Commands in =helm-find-files-ext.el=
** ZShell Like Path Expansion
   This enables zsh-style path expansion in Helm. For example, type =/h/q/f/b=
   and then execute the persistent action, the pattern expands to
   =/home/qjp/foo/bar=, =/home/qjp/foo1/bar1/= etc. Select the candidate using
   the helm interface.

   To enable it:
   : (helm-ff-ext-enable-zsh-path-expansion t)

   Demo:
   [[./screencasts/zsh-expansion.gif]]

** Auto Path Expansion
   This feature is an improved version of the zsh-style path expansion. The
   expansion is performed /ON-THE-FLY/ as you're typing the pattern!

   To enable it:
   : (helm-ff-ext-enable-auto-path-expansion t)

   Demo:
   [[./screencasts/auto-expansion.gif]]

** Skipping Dots
   When entering an *NON-EMPTY* directory using =helm-find-files=, skip the
   first two entries, =.= and =..=. But if the directory is *EMPTY*, the
   selection remains unchanged (still at the position of =.=).

   To enable it:
   : (helm-ff-ext-enable-skipping-dots t)

   Demo (note that the selection skips the first two entries, =.= and =..= when
   the directory is non-empty):
   [[./screencasts/skip-dots.gif]]

* Commands in =helm-minibuffer-ext.el=
** Use Header Line for Minibuffer Completions
   After enabling =helm-mode=, hitting =TAB= in the minibuffer when using
   commands like =eval-expression= (=M-:=) can also trigger the helm interface,
   but the problem is that the minibuffer is reused to enter the pattern so that
   we can't see the previous input in the minibuffer. So, instead of reusing the
   minibuffer to enter the pattern, use the header line to enter the pattern
   when the completion is triggered from the minibuffer.

   To enable it:
   : (helm-minibuffer-ext-enable-header-line-maybe t)

   Demo:
   [[./screencasts/minibuffer-header.gif]]

* WARNING
  *These are dirty hacks and it is highly likely that something may break after
  the helm updates!*
