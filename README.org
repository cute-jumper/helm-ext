#+TITLE: helm-ext

Extensions to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]], which I find useful but are unlikely to be accepted in the
upstream.

A collection of dirty hacks for helm!

* Skipping Dots
  When entering an *NON-EMPTY* directory using =helm-find-files=, skip the
  first two entries, =.= and =..=. But if the directory is *EMPTY*, the
  selection remains unchanged (still at the position of =.=).

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ext-ff-enable-skipping-dots t)

  Demo (note that the selection skips the first two entries, =.= and =..= when
  the directory is non-empty):
  [[./screencasts/skip-dots.gif]]

  It is also possible to "hide" the first two entries by recentering the first
  line. Use the following code to enable such behavior:
  : (setq helm-ext-ff-skipping-dots-recenter t)

  Demo:
  [[./screencasts/skip-dots-recenter.gif]]

  You can see from the demo that the first two entries are just visually
  "hiden". You can still use =C-p= to move the selection to them.

* ZShell Like Path Expansion
  This enables zsh-style path expansion in Helm. For example, type =/h/q/f/b=
  and then execute the persistent action, the pattern expands to
  =/home/qjp/foo/bar=, =/home/qjp/foo1/bar1/= etc. Select the candidate using
  the helm interface.

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ext-ff-enable-zsh-path-expansion t)

  Demo:
  [[./screencasts/zsh-expansion.gif]]

  Here is an [[http://cute-jumper.github.io/emacs/2015/11/17/let-helm-support-zshlike-path-expansion][old blog]] of mine dicussing about this feature. Note that now helm
  already has the ability to search the directory recursively using the
  =locate= command as the backend, which is quite different. For me, I prefer
  my own approach since it feels more consistent when I switch between =zsh=
  and =helm=.

* Auto Path Expansion
  This feature is an improved version of the zsh-style path expansion. The
  expansion is performed /ON-THE-FLY/ as you're typing the pattern!

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ext-ff-enable-auto-path-expansion t)

  (If you choose to enable this feature, then you don't need the previous
  zsh-path-expansion.)

  Demo:
  [[./screencasts/auto-expansion.gif]]

  To be improved: remove the restriction of only performing prefix matching in
  each level, making the matching behave more "fuzzily".

* Use Header Line for Minibuffer Completions
  After enabling =helm-mode=, hitting =TAB= in the minibuffer when using
  commands like =eval-expression= (=M-:=) can also trigger the helm interface,
  but the problem is that the minibuffer is reused to enter the pattern so that
  we can't see the previous input in the minibuffer. So, instead of reusing the
  minibuffer to enter the pattern, use the header line to enter the pattern
  when the completion is triggered from the minibuffer.

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ext-minibuffer-enable-header-line-maybe t)

  Demo:
  [[./screencasts/minibuffer-header.gif]]

* Other Tools
  [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/ace-jump-helm-line][ace-jump-helm-line]] can be used for quick navigation in the helm window, which
  uses [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]] behind the scenes. Helm itself also has a lightweight alternative
  called =helm-linum-relative-mode= (type =C-x number= to select a candidate).

* WARNING
  *These are dirty hacks and it is highly likely that something may be BROKEN
  after the helm updates!*
