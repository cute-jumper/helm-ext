#+TITLE: helm-ext

My own extensions to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]], which I find useful but are probably not accepted in
upstream.

* ZShell Like Path Expansion

  This enables zsh-style path expansion in Helm. For example, type =/h/q/f/b= and
  then execute the persistent action, the pattern expands to
  =/home/qjp/foo/bar=, =/home/qjp/foo1/bar1/= etc. Select the one you need using
  the helm interface.

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ff-ext-enable-zsh-path-expansion t)

  Demo:
  [[./screencasts/zsh-expansion.gif]]

* Auto Path Expansion
  This feature is similar to the previous one: zsh-style path expansion, but the
  expansion is performed on-the-fly.

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ff-ext-enable-auto-path-expansion t)

  Demo:
  [[./screencasts/auto-expansion.gif]]

* Skipping Dots
  I find it annoying that the default selection is =.= when you use
  =helm-find-files= to enter a new directory. Enable this will skip the first
  two entries, =.= and =..= when the directory is *not* empty. But if the
  directory is empty, which means there are only =.= and =..= in the current
  directory, then the selection still remains at the position of =.=.

  To enable it:
  : (helm-ff-ext-enable-skipping-dots t)

  Demo (note that the selection skips the first two entries, =.= and =..= when
  the directory is non-empty):
  [[./screencasts/skip-dots.gif]]
